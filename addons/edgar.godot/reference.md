# Edgar.Godot Reference

## Proxy System

A **proxy** is a GDScript that handles loading room templates. It decouples the renderer from the file format — swap the proxy to support different room sources (Tiled maps, Godot scenes, etc.) without changing the renderer.

### Contract

A proxy script must expose these static methods:

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `load_room(template: String, post_processor: String) -> Node` | `Node` | Load a room template, run post-processing, return the node tree |
| `get_anchor(template: String) -> Vector2` | `Vector2` | Return the room's anchor position in tile coordinates |
| `get_lnk(template: String) -> Dictionary` | `{ "boundary", "doors", "transformations" }` | Return the room's lnk topology metadata |

> [!NOTE]  
> The proxy contract is duck-typed — there is no base class to extend. Any `.gd` script with the three methods above qualifies.

### Configuration

Set via **Project Settings** → `Edgar/kernel/edgar_kernel_proxy` (a file path to a `.gd` script).

Default: `res://addons/edgar.godot/proxy/yati/edgar_yati_proxy.gd`

### Built-in: YATI Proxy

The default proxy handles Tiled maps (`.tmx` / `.tmj`). It bundles YATI runtime under `proxy/yati/runtime/` and extracts room metadata via `EdgarMetaParser` without creating Godot nodes for the metadata pass.

### Writing a Custom Proxy

Create a `.gd` script implementing the three contract methods, then set `Edgar/kernel/edgar_kernel_proxy` to its path.

## Making room templates

### Godot 2D scenes

The native godot 2d scene is supported in edgar.godot.  
To implement plain text loading instead of `\*.tscn/\*.scn`, please check [tiled-mapeditor](#tiled-map-layers). 

---

Use `Project > Tools > Create Edgar Room Template Scene 2D` to create a template room based on godot scene 2d. 

To provide the geometry messages for edgar, please adjust the `EdgarBoundary2D` and `EdgarAnchor2D` node.  

To define doors, put multiple `EdgarDoor2D` under `EdgarDesigner2D` (the `lnk` node). And make it multi-polyline to define door segments. And voilà!  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default proxy `edgar_yati_proxy` has the ability to handle it.  
> Nothing need to change.  

#### lnk

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> `lnk` is used to define the topology of the room connections, which is a `Dictionary`. 

##### Boundary

The boundary must be a clock-wise polygon, with each segment being orthogonal. 

#### Door

> [!NOTE]  
> The `Door` objects is a polyline with multiple segments.  
> Each segment is considered as the length of the door.  
> Example: The total height of the opening is 6, the usable height of a single door is 2. The default segments are [0,2], [2,4], [4,6], so the cooperative movement step between the two rooms is 2.  
> If an additional independent `Door` is added with overlapping segments [1,3], [3,5], then the full set of usable segments becomes [0,2], [1,3], [2,4], [3,5], [4,6], and the minimal alignment step decreases to 1. This makes the movement unit along that edge smaller, increases the number of alignment positions, and enriches possible generation combinations.  
> Summary: Adding overlapping segments reduces the minimal step size, enabling finer control and more generation possibilities.

The doors segments must be orthogonal. 

#### Anchor

> [!NOTE]  
> An `Anchor` marks the pivot point of a room.
> During rendering, the position of each `TileMapLayer` is offset by the anchor of the **pivot room**.

### Tiled Map Layers

Alternatively, you could use the `Tiled-mapeditor` instead of [godot scene](#godot-2d-scenes). 

---

"col": The main brick layer of the map.  
"markers": The marker layer for defining special objects for later use.  
"lnk": The layer defining the topology of room connections.  
xxx: Custom layers defined by the user.

#### lnk
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> `lnk` is used to define the topology of the room connections, which is a object layer.  
> Only the first object in the layer is considered.  

A valid `lnk` layer should be:
1. name = "lnk"

##### Boundary
A valid `Boundary` should be:
1. class = "polygon" (built-in in `YATI`, not `Edgar.Godot`)
2. property `lnk` = "boundary" or name = "Boundary"

##### Door
A valid `Door` should be:
1. class = "line" (built-in in `YATI`, not `Edgar.Godot`)
2. property `lnk` = "door"

> [!NOTE]  
> The `Door` objects is a polyline with multiple segments.  
> Each segment is considered as the length of the door.  
> Example: The total height of the opening is 6, the usable height of a single door is 2. The default segments are [0,2], [2,4], [4,6], so the cooperative movement step between the two rooms is 2.  
> If an additional independent `Door` is added with overlapping segments [1,3], [3,5], then the full set of usable segments becomes [0,2], [1,3], [2,4], [3,5], [4,6], and the minimal alignment step decreases to 1. This makes the movement unit along that edge smaller, increases the number of alignment positions, and enriches possible generation combinations.  
> Summary: Adding overlapping segments reduces the minimal step size, enabling finer control and more generation possibilities.

##### Anchor
A valid `Anchor` should be:
1. property `lnk` = "anchor" or name = "Anchor"

> [!NOTE]  
> An `Anchor` marks the pivot point of a room.
> During rendering, the position of each `TileMapLayer` is offset by the anchor of the **pivot room**.

##### Transformations
To enable transformations, add the following meta-data to the `lnk` layer:
1. `transformations`: A string json containing the transformation parameters.
	- e.g. `[0, 4]`

> [!NOTE]  
> 0: Identity  
> 1: Rotate90  
> 2: Rotate180  
> 3: Rotate270  
> 4: MirrorX  
> 5: MirrorY  
> 6: Diagonal13  
> 7: Diagonal24  

#### col
See [col](#col-1) in Renderer section for details.

## Room Graph Format

`Edgar.Godot` uses a custom JSON format (`.edgar-graph`) to define room connectivity, room type categories, and their associated Tiled map files.

### Structure

```json
{
    "edges": [...],
    "layer_names": [...],
    "layers": [...],
    "nodes": {...}
}
```

#### edges
Array of connection objects defining the topology between rooms:
```json
{"from_node": "Room 1", "to_node": "Room 2"}
```

#### layer_names
Array of strings defining room type categories (e.g., `["combat", "limit"]`).  
Each room is assigned to one category via the `edgar_layer` index in its node data.

> [!NOTE]  
> Since v0.4.0, layer names are stored per-graph under the `layer_names` key. Older graphs automatically migrate from ProjectSettings on import.

#### layers
Array of arrays containing file paths to Tiled map files (`*.tmj` / `*.tmx`) for each room type.  
Index 0 corresponds to `layer_names[0]`, and so on.

#### nodes
Dictionary mapping room names to their properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `edgar_layer` | `int` | Index into `layer_names` for this room's type |
| `is_corridor_room` | `int` | Room type category (0 = normal, 1+ = corridor variants) |
| `is_pivot` | `bool` | Whether this room serves as the pivot for coordinate offsets |
| `position_offset` | `Object(x, y)` | Position in the graph editor |

### Graph Editor

The plugin provides a visual graph editor for creating and editing `.edgar-graph` files directly in Godot.

#### Layer Management
- **Add layers**: Click the **+** button in the Layers panel
- **Rename layers**: Click the name on a layer card
- **Delete layers**: Click the trash icon on a layer card
- **Assign rooms**: Use the layer dropdown on each room node

> [!NOTE]  
> When a layer is deleted, nodes on that layer are reassigned to layer 0, and nodes above shift down by one.

## Renderer

A renderer converts an Edgar.Godot layout into Godot nodes (typically `TileMapLayer`). It supports tile and room filtering via metadata and emits signals for post‑processing.

### col
The `col` layer is the brick layer of the map. Obviously, there should be multiple `col` layers if the map has multiple tilemaps.  

To achieve this, you need to set the meta-data `tiled_layer` on each `TileMapLayer` node of a renderer, specifying which Tiled layer it corresponds to.  

For example, if you have two tilemaps in Tiled named "Ground" and "Decorations", you would create two `TileMapLayer` nodes under the renderer, each with the `tiled_layer` meta-data set to "Ground" and "Decorations" respectively.

> [!NOTE]  
> For simplicity, you can name the `TileMapLayer` nodes the same as their corresponding Tiled layers. For example, a `TileMapLayer` node named "col" would have the `tiled_layer` meta-data set to "col".

### Signals
- `post_process(renderer: EdgarRenderer2D, tile_map_layer: TileMapLayer, tiled_layer: String)`
- `marker_post_process(renderer: EdgarRenderer2D, tile_map_layer: TileMapLayer, marker: Node, data: Variant)`
- `custom_post_process(renderer: EdgarRenderer2D, tile_map_layer: TileMapLayer, layer: Node)`
- `clear_tiles(renderer: EdgarRenderer2D, tile_map_layer: TileMapLayer)`

You can connect to or await these signals to run custom logic after rendering.

#### Ways to integrate

1) Script-based (override methods)
- Extend `EdgarRenderer2D` and override:
```gdscript
extends EdgarRenderer2D

func _post_process(tile_map_layer: TileMapLayer, tiled_layer: String) -> void:
	# Custom per-layer post-processing
	pass

func _marker_post_process(tile_map_layer: TileMapLayer, marker: Node, data: Variant) -> void:
	# Custom marker post-processing
	pass

func _custom_post_process(tile_map_layer: TileMapLayer, layer: Node) -> void:
	pass

func _clear_tiles(tile_map_layer: TileMapLayer) -> void:
	# Custom tile clearing behavior
	# Default implementation: tile_map_layer.clear()
	pass
```
- Alternatively, implement hooks directly on a `TileMapLayer`. The renderer will detect and call them:
```gdscript
# On the TileMapLayer script
func _post_process(renderer: EdgarRenderer2D, tiled_layer: String) -> void:
	# Adjust this layer after rendering
	pass
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Overrides are executed via signals under the hood, so you can still `await` them even when using the override approach.

When overriding `_clear_tiles`, call `clear(tile_map_layer)` in your implementation if you want to emit the signal and allow other handlers to run as well.

2) Signal-based (connect handlers)

> [!NOTE]  
> If you connect to the `clear_tiles` signal, the default clearing behavior will still run because the default handler is already connected.  

To fully override the default behavior without overriding the method, you must disconnect the default connection first:

```gdscript
for conn in renderer.clear_tiles.get_connections():
	renderer.clear_tiles.disconnect(conn.callable) # or concrete connection that you want

# Connects to your own handler
renderer.clear_tiles.connect(_my_custom_clear_method)
```

### Tile Swapping
Most of the time, you would want to re-map / swap the tiles according to the transformation applied to the room.  
To achieve this, you can use tile meta-data to define the swapping rules.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These properties must be defined on the **Tileset** in the **Tiled Map Editor (tiled)** or **Tileset Panel (godot)**, specifically on the individual tiles themselves.

- In **Godot** *Custom Data Layer*, `tileswap4` = `Vector4i(source_id, atlas_x, atlas_y, alternative_tile)` defines the swapping rule for MirrorX (4) transformation.  
> [!NOTE]  
> To disable the swapping for some tiles, set the `x` component of it to be negative (e.g. `-1`)
- In **Tiled** *Custom Properties*, `tileswap4` = `Color(source_id, atlas_x, atlas_y, alternative_tile)` defines the swapping rule for MirrorX (4) transformation.  

When a tile is rendered in a room with MirrorX transformation, it will be swapped to the tile defined in the `tileswap4` meta-data.

## Filters
A filter is a set of conditions to determine which tiles or rooms should be rendered in the final map. This is especially useful when you have multiple layers in Tiled but only want to render specific parts in Godot, e.g., multi-layered tilemaps.  

### Tile Filters
To enable a tile filter, add the following meta-data to the target `TileMapLayer` node of a renderer:  
1. `tile_exceptions`: An `Dictionary[Vector4i, bool]` to filter the tiles that you do not want to render.  
2. `tile_inclusions`: An `Dictionary[Vector4i, bool]` to filter the tiles that you do **only** want to render.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use either `tile_exceptions` or `tile_inclusions` at a time.  
> If both are provided, only `tile_inclusions` will be considered.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The key of the dictionaries should be a `Vector4i` representing the tile's source ID and alternative tile, formatted as `(source_id: int, atlas_coord: Vector2i, alternative_tile: int)`.  

### Room Filters
To enable a room filter, add the following meta-data to the target `TileMapLayer` node of a renderer:  
1. `room_exceptions`: An `Dictionary[String, bool]` to filter the rooms that you do not want to render.  
2. `room_inclusions`: An `Dictionary[String, bool]` to filter the rooms that you do **only** want to render.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use either `room_exceptions` or `room_inclusions` at a time.  
> If both are provided, only `room_inclusions` will be considered.  

### Edgar Layer Filters
To enable an edgar layer filter (filter by room type), add the following meta-data to the target `TileMapLayer` node of a renderer:  
1. `edgar_layer_exceptions`: An `Dictionary[int, bool]` to filter the edgar layers that you do not want to render.  
2. `edgar_layer_inclusions`: An `Dictionary[int, bool]` to filter the edgar layers that you do **only** want to render.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use either `edgar_layer_exceptions` or `edgar_layer_inclusions` at a time.  
> If both are provided, only `edgar_layer_inclusions` will be considered.  
> This is useful for filtering rooms by their type (e.g., "BossRoom", "TreasureRoom") rather than individual room instances.

> See [Room Graph Format](#room-graph-format) for how `edgar_layer` indices map to layer names.

## Built-in Renderers

### EdgarRenderer2D

> This is the base class for all 2D renderers in Edgar.Godot. See the [Renderer](#renderer) section for signals, filters, and usage details.

### LoadableEdgarRenderer2D

A loadable renderer that supports dynamic loading and unloading of payloads (typically `PackedScene`) for chunk-based or partition-based rendering.

#### Methods

- `load_content() -> void`: Loads a payload scene into the renderer.
- `unload_content() -> void`: Unloads a previously loaded payload by its name.

#### Payload Scene Requirements

The **root node** of payload scene must define a `tile_map_layers` metadata property as `Array[NodePath]`. This exposes the renderable references to the renderer, which automatically validates and injects them.

> [!NOTE]  
> The renderer uses these NodePaths to manage and coordinate tile map layers across loaded payloads.
